        Modeling thermal grain emission is an unavoidable tool to study both
        the physics of local interstellar medium and the embedded star
        formation in distant galaxies. Modeling this emission usually relies on
        the possiblity of sampling dust models. For example, MCMC Bayesian
        models relies on interpolating large grids of pre-computed dust models
        in its quest to fit dust spectral energy distribution models. And most
        often, increasing any model's complexity; i.e increasing the number of
        modeling parameters, comes at the expense of larger grids and slower
        model fitting. Scalibility obstacles can be tamed by training a
        statisical estimator to approximate the model by training it on a
        discrete set of data points defined over a range of parameters, and
        therefore be able to sample the model-space without relying on model
        grids. This kind of estimators are usually neural networks, due to
        their approximative powers, and this kind of training is usually called
        model emulation.<br><br>

        We train a neural-network to emulate the dust emission spectra of a
        THEMIS dust model, by training it on emission as calculated by SwING
        (SoftWares for Investigating Nebulae and Galaxies) written by F.
        Galliano adapted to use the stellar evolution model and libraries of
        synthetic atmosphere spectra grids BPASS for modeling the interstellar
        radiation field. The model is trained on a large grid of models by
        varying three parameters: the mean power of the interstellar radiation
        field, \(U\), the age of the stars in the population \(\tau\), and the
        minimal size of dust grains considered for the THEMIS model,
        \(a_{min}\).<br><br>

        There exists a multitude of proposed dust models in the literature each
        based on a distinct choice of composition and size distribution. The
        degeneracy is due to, but not limited to, the fact that all models
        provide satisfying fits of the interstellar medium dust observables.
        Any dust model ought to account for empirical observables of the
        diffuse Galactic interstellar medium as the UV-to-MIR extinction, the
        infra-red (IR) emission, and mid-infra-red (MIR) spectral features. We
        make use of the ”The Heterogeneous dust Evolution Model for
        Interstellar Solids” (THEMIS) state-of-the-art dust model based on
        laboratory-measured properties of the family of hydrogenated amorphous
        carbons. The size distribution can be divided into three components:
        small carbons, big carbons, and silicates.<br><br>

        The heating and cooling of interstellar dust is controlled by the
        absorption and re-emission of electromagnetic radiation, mostly from
        the interstellar radiation field (ISRF). The interaction of an
        electromagnetic wave with a dust grain results in its fractional
        absorption as heat, and ulteriorly, its re-emission in the IR. This
        dynamics is governed by the interplay of two timescales, the absorption
        time, \(\tau_{abs}\), which gives the average time between two photon
        absorption, and the cooling rate, \(\tau_{cool}\), which gives the
        average cooling time. The absorption time, is inversely proportional to
        grain size. As the grain gets larger, it intercepts more photons. The
        cooling time is inversely proportional to the temperature and is
        independent of grain size. The more hot the grain is, the more
        energetic the absorbed photon is, the more fast its dissipation is.
        Out-of-equilibrium grains thus spend most of their time at low
        temperatures. Thermal equilibrium conditions are reached in specific
        scenarios controlled by the interplay between the intensity of the
        interstellar field radiation which controls the flux of incoming
        photons, and the grain size  which controls the thermal response of
        dust grains. The observed emission at a specific time is a sum of all
        emissions of individual grains of different sizes and different
        temperatures as every grain is at a different time stamp in its
        history. Therefore, the observed emission is described by the
        integration of individual grain emission over the temperature
        distribution of grains.<br><br>

        The dataset that was generated constitutes a large models grid of three
        parameters, the intensity of the interstellar radiation field, its population
        age, and the minimal size of grains. We set ranges for each parameter
        spanning over values of interest to interstellar medium (ISD) studies.
        In total, our dataset will comprise 51 \(\times\) 51 \(\times\) 91 = 236691 model dust
        emission spectra. And a neural network was trained on those.
