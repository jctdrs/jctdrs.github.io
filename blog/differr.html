        Let \(\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}\) be a random vector with mean
        \(\boldsymbol{\mu_{x}}\) and covariance matrix \(\boldsymbol{\Sigma_{x}}
        \) and let \(f: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}\) be a
        nonlinear function. Up to first-order approximation, \(\boldsymbol{y}=
        f(\boldsymbol{x}) \approx f(\boldsymbol{\mu_{x}}) + J(\boldsymbol{x-
        \mu_{x}})\), where \(J \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\) is the Jacobian
        matrix \(\partial f/\partial \boldsymbol{x}\) evaluated at
        \(\boldsymbol{\mu_{x}}\). This approximation is reasonably
        accepted\(^{*}\) and the random vector \(\boldsymbol{y} \in
        \mathbb{R}^{m}\) has mean \(\boldsymbol{\mu_{y}} \approx
        f(\boldsymbol{\mu_{x}})\) and covariance \(\Sigma_{y} \approx J
        \Sigma_{x} J^{T}\).<br>
        <br>
        For example, if \(\boldsymbol{x}\) is composed of two random vectors
        \(\boldsymbol{a}\) and \(\boldsymbol{b}\) such that \(\boldsymbol{x}=(
        \boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{b})\), then<br> <p
        style="text-align:center">\(\Sigma_{y} = \begin{bmatrix}
        J_{\boldsymbol{a}} & J_{\boldsymbol{b}} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
        \sigma_{\boldsymbol{a}} & \sigma_{\boldsymbol{ab}} \\
        \sigma_{\boldsymbol{ba}} & \sigma_{\boldsymbol{b}} \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix} J_{\boldsymbol{a}}^{T} \\ J_\boldsymbol{b}^{T}
        \end{bmatrix} + O(N^2) \) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(1)</p><br> where
        \(J_{\boldsymbol{a}}=\partial\boldsymbol{y}/\partial \boldsymbol{a}\)
        and \(J_{\boldsymbol{b}}=\partial\boldsymbol{y}/ \partial \boldsymbol{b}
        \).<br>
        <br>
        It can be seen that the uncertainty, characterized by the covariance
        matrix, \( \Sigma_{\boldsymbol{x}} \), of the input data
        \(\boldsymbol{x}\), is propagated to first degree by the Jacobian,
        \(J\), through the operation, \( f \).<br>
        <br>

        <p style="font-size:11px"><b>Example</b><br></p>
        I&#39;ll illustrate the idea with an application from multi-wavelength
        astronomy of comparing images of the same physical object taken from
        different instruments with different resolutions. One would have to
        degrade the images to a minimum common resolution and then re-grid to a
        common pixel size; by this, homogenize multiple images while preserving
        the colors of the astronomical source. Resolution degradation is
        achieved by convolving the image with a specially constructed
        kernel\(^{**}\) which depends on the ratio of the initial and target
        resolutions. Regridding is achieved by interpolating the image to a new
        pixel grid defined by the target pixel size. Let \( \boldsymbol{x} \),
        be a regularly gridded image of dimensions \( n\times m \) with
        covariance matrix \( \Sigma_{\boldsymbol{x}} \). Then, \( y \), is the
        result image of dimensions \( n&#39;\times m&#39; \) with \( n&#39; \leq
        n \) and \( m&#39; \leq m \), where \(\boldsymbol{y} = h(
        \boldsymbol{x}) = ( g \circ f)(\boldsymbol{x}) \), where \(f\) and \(g\)
        the degrading and re-gridding operation respectively, and \( \Sigma_{y}
        \) the propagated uncertainty of \(\boldsymbol{y}\).<br>

        <p style="font-size:11px"><b>Implementation</b><br></p>
        Assuming the input covariance matrix, \(\Sigma_{\boldsymbol{x}}\), to
        have zero non-diagonal elements, then every pixel \((i,j)\) of the
        initial uncertainty map is equal to the total variance, \(\sigma_{i,i}\)
        of the input pixel \(\boldsymbol{x_{i,j}}\). This assumes no
        correlation between uncertainties in different pixels. <br>
        <br>
        Resolution degradation is done by convolving the image with a specific
        kernel based on the ratio of initial and target resolutions.  The
        convolution, \(\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{x}\star K\), can be written as
        \(\boldsymbol{y}[i,j] = \sum_{n,m}K[n,m]\times x[i-n,j-m]\).  The
        Jacobian is an array with each row corresponding to an output pixel
        \(y[i,j]\), equal to the partial derivative of \(y[i,j]\) with respect
        to \(x[k,l]\) is simply \(K[i-k, j-l]\). This shows that the derivative
        at each pixel is the kernel itself but shifted depending on the position
        of the pixel with respect to the center of the kernel. Following
        equation (1), and assuming independent initial uncertainties, the
        propagated uncertainty \(\sigma_{y}\) at \((i,j)\) is
        \(\sigma_{y}^{2}[i,j] = \sum_{n,m}K[n,m]^{2}\times \sigma_{x}^{2}[i-m,
        j-n]\), which is nothing but convolving the square of the initial
        uncertainties with the square of the kernel,
        \(\sigma_{y}^{2}=\sigma_{x}^{2}\star K{^2}\). Klein (2021)*** offers a
        more general method for uncertainty propgation in convolution while
        taking into account cross-correlations between pixels.

        A more applicable method, is to estimate the propagated uncertainty by
        repeating the same process and by adding a random noise to each pixel
        from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation equal to the
        uncertainty associated with each pixel. With enough repetition, one can
        estimate the propagated uncertainty of each output pixel by the
        standard deviation of its values over all iterations. This method,
        known as bootstrapping or Monte-Carlo, can be shown to be equivalent to
        equation \((1)\), and therefore converges after enough iterations to
        the <i>differr</i> method.<br>
