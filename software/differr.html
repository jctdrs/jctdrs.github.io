      Which is about once we have some estimate of the uncertainties, how to
      propaagte them through complex data processing and modeling.  This will
      be illustrated by an astrophysical application. The fact that in many
      situations we need to peropagate uncertainties through complex nonlinear
      operations. the casee of interest in whenm we need top analyze
      multi-wavelenght images of the same physcial space through complex
      background subtraction, then degrading all images to a common resolution
      by convolving with a kernel and then project all images to a common grid
      so degrade them. These different steps will change the noise level also
      its distribution and its correlation.
