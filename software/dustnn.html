        Modeling thermal grain emission is an unavoidable tool to study the
        physics of the interstellar medium. Modeling this emission usually
        relies on sampling dust emission models. For example, MCMC Bayesian
        models rely on interpolating large grids of pre-computed dust emission
        models in their quest to fit the dust emission spectral energy
        distribution. Most often, increasing the model's complexity; i.e
        increasing the number of its modeling parameters, comes at the expense
        of larger grids and fits. Scalibility obstacles can be tamed by
        training a statisical estimator to approximate the model and to sample
        the model-space.<br><br>

        The heating and cooling of interstellar dust is controlled by the
        absorption and re-emission of electromagnetic radiation from the
        interstellar radiation field (ISRF). The interaction of an
        electromagnetic wave with a dust grain results in its fractional
        absorption as heat, and ulteriorly, its re-emission in the infra-red.
        This dynamics is governed by the interplay of two timescales, the
        absorption time, \(\tau_{abs}\), the average time between two photon
        absorptions, and the cooling rate, \(\tau_{cool}\), the average cooling
        time.<br><br>

                10 Gyr, and mean intensity U=1. The energy distribution of

        The absorption time, \(\tau_{abs}\), is inversely proportional to grain
        size: as the grain gets larger, it intercepts more photons. Whereas the
        cooling time, \(\tau_{cool}\), is inversely proportional to the
        temperature and is independent of grain size. The hotter the grain is,
        the more energetic the absorbed photon is, the faster its dissipation
        is. Therefore, out-of-equilibrium grains are smaller grains and spend
        most of their time at low temperatures, whereas, large grains tend to
        be in thermal equilibrium.  The total emission at a specific time is a
        sum of the emissions of all the individual grains of different sizes
        and different temperatures.<br><br>

        <b>Implementation</b><br>
        </p>
        The emission of a dust mixture subjected to the ISRF can be modeled
        with the intensity and spectral distribution of the ISRF, as well as,
        the composition and size distribution of the dust mixture.<br><br>

        We train a neural-network to emulate the dust emission spectra of a
        THEMIS dust model, by training it on emission as calculated by SwING
        (SoftWares for Investigating Nebulae and Galaxies) written by F.
        Galliano adapted to use the stellar evolution model and libraries of
        synthetic atmosphere spectra grids BPASS for modeling the interstellar
        radiation field. The model is trained on a large grid of models by
        varying three parameters: the mean power of the interstellar radiation
        field, \(U\), the age of the stars in the population \(\tau\), and the
        minimal size of dust grains considered for the THEMIS model,
        \(a_{min}\). The dataset that was generated constitutes a large models
        grid of three parameters, the intensity of the interstellar radiation
        field, its population age, and the minimal size of grains. We set
        ranges for each parameter spanning over values of interest to
        interstellar medium (ISD) studies.  In total, our dataset will comprise
        51 \(\times\) 51 \(\times\) 91 = 236691 model dust emission spectra
